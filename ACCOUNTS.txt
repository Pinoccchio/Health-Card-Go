HEALTHCARD SYSTEM - TEST ACCOUNTS
Next.js + Supabase Implementation
========================================

Last Updated: December 5, 2025
Total Accounts: 3 Active (1 Super Admin + 1 Doctor + 1 Patient)

NOTE: For easy testing, you can use email as password (e.g., email: test@test.com, password: test@test.com)
      Or follow the pattern [Role]@2025! for standardized test passwords.
      Use these accounts for development and testing only.

IMPORTANT: Most test accounts from seeding have been deleted.
           The system has been restructured to use service-based assignments.

ROLE STRUCTURE (Updated Dec 5, 2025)
========================================

The system now uses a service-based architecture for Healthcare Admins:

1. SUPER ADMIN (role: super_admin)
   - Full system access
   - Create all user types
   - Manage all services and records

2. HEALTHCARE ADMIN (role: healthcare_admin)
   - Service-specific access via assigned_service_id
   - Manage appointments for assigned service only
   - Create/edit/delete announcements
   - Access service-specific records
   - Generate service reports

3. STAFF (role: staff) - NEW ROLE
   - Disease surveillance for ALL diseases
   - Enter disease data (Dengue, Measles, Rabies, Malaria, etc.)
   - Generate disease reports
   - View analytics and predictions
   - NO appointment management access

4. DOCTOR (role: doctor) - DEPRECATED
   - Kept for backward compatibility
   - View ALL records during active appointments
   - Create medical records
   - Enter diagnoses (triggers disease surveillance)
   - Complete appointments

5. PATIENT (role: patient)
   - Book appointments (7-day lead time)
   - View own records
   - Download health card
   - Submit feedback
   - Status: pending/active/rejected

========================================
SERVICES & SERVICE ID MAPPING
========================================

Healthcare Admins are now assigned to specific services via assigned_service_id.
Each Healthcare Admin manages appointments for ONE specific service only.

📋 COMPLETE SERVICES REFERENCE TABLE
=====================================

| ID | Service Name                      | Category      | Description                                    | Duration | Appointment? |
|----|-----------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|
| 1  | Health Card Processing            | healthcard    | NEW health card application for new patients   | 30 min   | Required     |
| 2  | Health Card Renewal               | healthcard    | RENEWAL of existing/expired health cards       | 20 min   | Required     |

⚠️  IMPORTANT: HEALTH CARD SERVICES CLARIFICATION
================================================

Service ID 1 vs Service ID 2 - What's the difference?

• Service ID: 1 (Health Card Processing)
  → For NEWLY APPROVED patients applying for their FIRST health card
  → Takes 30 minutes (includes photo, verification, encoding)
  → Example: Patient just got approved by Super Admin, needs new health card

• Service ID: 2 (Health Card Renewal)
  → For EXISTING patients renewing EXPIRED or DAMAGED health cards
  → Takes 20 minutes (faster process, patient already in system)
  → Example: Patient's health card expired or was lost/damaged

Why are they separate?
- Different processing times (30 min vs 20 min)
- Different workflows (new enrollment vs renewal)
- Allows specialization: One Healthcare Admin can focus on new cards, another on renewals
- Better queue management and appointment scheduling

When creating a Healthcare Admin:
- Assign to Service 1 if they handle NEW health card applications
- Assign to Service 2 if they handle RENEWALS/REPLACEMENTS
- You can create separate admins for each service if needed

LEGACY MAPPING (admin_category → assigned_service_id):
- healthcard admin → Service ID: 1 (Health Card Processing) OR Service ID: 2 (Health Card Renewal)
- hiv admin → Service ID: 3 (HIV Testing & Counseling)
- pregnancy admin → Service ID: 4 (Prenatal Checkup)
- laboratory admin → Service ID: 7 (Basic Laboratory Tests)
- immunization admin → Service ID: 5 (Child Immunization) OR Service ID: 6 (Adult Vaccination)
- general_admin → REMOVED (role no longer used)

========================================
TEMPLATE ACCOUNTS FOR TESTING
