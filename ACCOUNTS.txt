========================================
🔧 DYNAMIC SIDEBAR IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC
========================================

The system uses the following logic (from src/lib/config/menuItems.ts):

```typescript
export function getHealthcareAdminMenuItems(user: User) {
  // Base items (always shown)
  const menuItems = [
    { label: 'Dashboard', href: '/healthcare-admin/dashboard', icon: LayoutDashboard },
  ];

  // Fetch assigned service from database
  const service = getServiceById(user.assigned_service_id);

  // Dynamic item: Appointments OR Walk-in Queue
  if (service.requires_appointment) {
    menuItems.push({ label: 'Appointments', href: '/healthcare-admin/appointments', icon: Calendar });
  } else {
    menuItems.push({ label: 'Walk-in Queue', href: '/healthcare-admin/walk-in', icon: Users });
  }

  // Always show Patients
  menuItems.push({ label: 'Patients', href: '/healthcare-admin/patients', icon: Users });

  // Conditional: Medical Records (only if service requires it)
  if (service.requires_medical_record) {
    menuItems.push({ label: 'Medical Records', href: '/healthcare-admin/medical-records', icon: FileText });
  }

  // Always show Reports and Announcements
  menuItems.push({ label: 'Reports', href: '/healthcare-admin/reports', icon: BarChart });
  menuItems.push({ label: 'Announcements', href: '/healthcare-admin/announcements', icon: Megaphone });

  return menuItems;
}
```

Page-Level Access Guards (from src/lib/utils/serviceAccessGuard.ts):

```typescript
export function canAccessMedicalRecords(service: Service): boolean {
  return service.requires_medical_record === true;
}

export function canAccessAppointments(service: Service): boolean {
  return service.requires_appointment === true;
}

export function canAccessWalkInQueue(service: Service): boolean {
  return service.requires_appointment === false;
}
```

If a Healthcare Admin tries to access a page their service doesn't support:
- Redirect to /healthcare-admin/dashboard
- Show error toast: "Your service does not support this feature"
